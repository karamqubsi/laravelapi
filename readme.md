# Laravel 5.7 (with JWT and Dingo API)

I just installed laravel latest version then installed JWT and DIngo API, I did some cofiguration then I copied  controllors and some configuration from:
[francescomalatesta/laravel-api-boilerplate-jwt](https://github.com/francescomalatesta/laravel-api-boilerplate-jwt)

I used to use that project but I needed to use Laravel 5.7. and that project not yet supporting it.
